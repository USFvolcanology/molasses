Available Modules for MOLASSES

MODULE NAME

Driver
  00
    Flow Limited Model: flow will stop when volume remaining to erupt = 0, distribute module is called once more.
  01
    Deformation Limited Model: flow will stop when the total vertical deformation of all cells < 1e-11 meters, or a new cell has not been created in 10 seconds.

Initialize
  00
    A Configuration File is read in. Searches for multiple vents and multiple output file types.

DEM_loader
  00
    Loads a raster through GDAL to input global elevations, elevation uncertainties, or residual thicknesses.

Array_initializer
  00
    Allocates memory for the global data grid and the active list

Flow_initializer
  00
    Activates vent locations and adds user-input uncertainty to the elevation map

Pulse
  00
    Delivers lava to vent locations if there is still volume to erupt at each

Distribute
  00
    IMMEDIATELY UPDATES Cellular Automata and determines how much lava to share between neighbors PROPORTIONAL TO SLOPE. The Center Cell will SHARE ALL VOLUME of lava it contains ABOVE the RESIDUAL VOLUME.
  01
    IMMEDIATELY UPDATES Cellular Automata and shares lava EVENLY to all lower neighbors NOT-PROPORTIONAL TO SLOPE. The Center Cell will SHARE ALL VOLUME of lava it contains ABOVE the RESIDUAL VOLUME.
  02
    Updates Cellular Automata ALL AT ONCE and determines how much lava to share between neighbors PROPORTIONAL TO SLOPE. The Center Cell will SHARE ALL VOLUME of lava it contains ABOVE the RESIDUAL VOLUME.
  03
    Updates Cellular Automata ALL AT ONCE and shares lava EVENLY to all lower neighbors NOT-PROPORTIONAL TO SLOPE. The Center Cell will SHARE ALL VOLUME of lava it contains ABOVE the RESIDUAL VOLUME.
  04
    Updates Cellular Automata ALL AT ONCE and determines how much lava to share between neighbors PROPORTIONAL TO SLOPE. The Center Cell will SHARE MAXIMUM VOLUME of lava that keeps it AT OR ABOVE Neighboring cells.

Neighbor_ID
  00
    4-connected: Neighbors will be found in the four cardinal directions of the Global Data Grid (up down left and right)
  01
    8-connected: Neighbors will be found in the eight ordinal directions of the Global Data Grid (up down left right up-left up-right down-right down-left)

Activate
  00
    Uses the input parent code to define parent-child relationships
  01
    Ignores the input parent code, defining exactly 0 parent-child relationships.
Output
  00
    Flows and/or the global data grid will be output based on a code. Outputs include an ASCII X,Y,Thickness list of the flow, a Binary (1 or 0) hit map, a thickness map, an underlying elevation map, or a new elevation (elevation + thickness) map. All maps are output as .tifs.
