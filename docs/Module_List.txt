Available Modules for MOLASSES

MODULE NAME
  code
    description
    
Driver
  00
    Flow Limited Model: flow will stop when volume remaining to erupt = 0, distribute module is called once more.
  01
    Deformation Limited Model: flow will stop when the total vertical deformation of all cells < 1e-11 meters, or a new cell has not been created in 10 seconds.

Initialize
  00
    A Configuration File is read in. Searches for multiple vents and multiple output file types.

DEM_loader
  00
    Loads a raster through GDAL to input global elevations, elevation uncertainties, or residual thicknesses.

Array_initializer
  00
    Allocates memory for the global data grid and the active list

Flow_initializer
  00
    Activates vent locations and adds user-input uncertainty to the elevation map

Pulse
  00
    Delivers lava to vent locations if there is still volume to erupt at each

Distribute
  00
    Slope-based sharing: Will share lava to neighboring cells proportional to the slope or relief in a given direction
  01
    Equal sharing: Will share lava evenly to all neighboring cells which are below the current location
  02
    Fair-share: not functional yet
  03
    Slope-based sharing with updating parent-child relationships: If a cell gives lava to another, it cannot later receive lava from that neighbor during each call to the distribute function. Each time the function is called, the P-C relationships are reset.
  04
    Equal sharing with updating parent-child relationships

Neighbor_ID
  00
    4-connected: Neighbors will be found in the four cardinal directions of the Global Data Grid (up down left and right)
  01
    8-connected: Neighbors will be found in the eight ordinal directions of the Global Data Grid (up down left right up-left up-right down-right down-left)

Activate
  00
    Uses the input parent code to define parent-child relationships
  01
    Ignores the input parent code, defining exactly 0 parent-child relationships.
Output
  00
    Flows and/or the global data grid will be output based on a code. Outputs include an ASCII X,Y,Thickness list of the flow, a Binary (1 or 0) hit map, a thickness map, an underlying elevation map, or a new elevation (elevation + thickness) map. All maps are output as .tifs.
