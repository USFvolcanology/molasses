NAME
	MOLASSES
 
DESCRIPTION
  MOLASSES is an in-progress fluid flow simulator, written in C. It is not yet complete and is in need of testing and additional programming before it can be used effectively.
  MOLASSES stands for MOdular LAva Simulation Software for Earth Science.
  
REQUIREMENTS
	MOLASSES requires the GDAL C libraries and a C compiler. To get the GDAL libraries, install gdal-devel on your UNIX machine. We have tested this program on computers that use the C compiler gcc.

INSTALLATION
	Before compilation of MOLASSES it is prudent to modify the Makefile in this directory for your use. Check to make sure that the installation path and the path to GDAL are properly set. Modify the module numbers at the top of the Makefile to change the model algorithm to what you require.

	To compile and install MOLASSES execute the following commands:
		make
		make install
	You may need to be in super-user mode to perform make install.

EXECUTING
	To run the code after installation, use the command
		molasses <config-file>
	where <config-file> is a text configuration file. A sample configuration file (sample.cfg) is given in the main directory. An elevation model is required to run molasses, and at least one output file path and one vent location must be given in the configuration file. More information is documented in the docs directory.

UNINSTALLATION
	To uninstall MOLASSES run
		make uninstall
