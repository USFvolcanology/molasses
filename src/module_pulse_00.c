	If volume remains to be erupted, delivers a pre-defined pulse of magma to each
	vent cell and subtracts this pulse from the vent cell's volume. Returns the

	Algorithm:
	  If more lava remains to be erupted:
	    Search Cellular Automata List for first Vent
	    Calculate thickness to deliver to first vent
	    Add thickness to vent cell, subtract volume from remaining volume in cell
	    Repeat search for vents, until number of found vents==no. of known vents
	      Calculate total volume remaining, exit
	  If no lava remains to be erupted:
	    Exit without doing anything
	  If negative lava remains:
	    Exit with an Error
	  If not all vents were found:
	    Exit with an Error
