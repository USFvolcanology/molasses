/*Module: DISTRIBUTE
          Distributes lava from central cells which have a residual amount of
          lava to lower cells in a neighborhood.
          Arguments:
            dataCell dataGrid     - a 2D Global Data Grid
            Automata CAList       - a cellular automata list of active cells
            unsigned activeCount  - the number of elements within CAList
            double   gridMetadata - geometry of the Global Data Grid
          
          Algorithm:
            Until counter = the cell count in CAList when module was called:
              IF CAList[counter] (center cell) has enough lava to spread:
                Identify cells in local neighborhood which can receive lava
                IF there are cells:
                  Define volume to advect away from center cell
                  Calculate Cell-Cell elevation reliefs and sum them
                  FOR each neighbor:
                    Determine Effective center cell - neighbor Cell relief
                    If neighbor cell is not in CAList, append with ACTIVATE
                    Determine volume to add to neighbor cell
                    Add thickness of lava to neighbor's  IN  transition property
                  Add total vol. distributed to center's OUT transition property
              Increment counter and test against number of cells in CAList
            
            For all cells in CAList:
              update lava thicknesses with transition properties
              reset transition properties
          
          Return total number of active cells and updated CAList with pointers
